### FAQ

**Should I call my method on the board?** - No.  But definitely run values through to test at the end.

**Is forEach / map etc... better than `for` loops?** - Mostly no.  Not unless you are _super_ dialed on them.

**What should I ask about inputs?** - If the interviewer gives you the shape of the input (aka "an array of strings") then just assume that'll always be there.  If they _don't_ give the shape of the input, make an assumption and make that known.

**What questions are OK to ask?** - Generally speaking ask clarifying questions.

Definitely ask:

- "Can I use this built-in method in [whatever language you are in]?  Is that in-bounds?"

Avoid:

- asking them if what you should call a method (instead pick a name and maybe ask if that makes sense to them)
- what a method should return (instead make a guess and confirm that you are right)
- how would you like me to do _xyz_?  Instead, discuss tradeoffs of approaches, pick one and explain why (they'll stop you if you are way off)

**Should I write the question on the board?** - Not a bad idea.  Make sure it's 100% accurate though - if you transcribe it wrong that's kinda bad.  Confirm that what you wrote is correct.  Ideally use shorthand (not word-for-word).

**What if I need to "correct" my code, should I erase/rewrite?** - If you forgot to add a line, it's totally OK to add that line off to the side and draw an arrow.  You have a short time, re-writing whole sections of code is a waste.

**What if I'm totally stuck and can't move on?** - Be honest about it.  Propose alternatives.  If you can't do something recursively, but _could_ do it in a `for` loop, say that, and ask if that's OK.  As a last-ditch effort, ask "could you help me get started here?  I'm really nervous and totally blanking..."

**Does handwriting matter?** - Only insofar as it's legible.  Generally speaking beginners tend to write bigger than necessary, and tend to run out of room.  Spacially organize it so you have room for test code, sample inputs, and the problem description.

**Does spacial layout matter?** - Only insofar as you can fit everything.  If you need to, refer to this diagram for a suggested layout for a single whiteboard:
