# Whiteboard Interview Prep (groups)

## Standard

Employ a methodical process when solving an algorithm

## Objectives

By the end of this training, you should be able to perform the following steps consistently when solving a problem at a whiteboard:

- Confirm 2-3 inputs/outputs with the interviewer
- Ask questions that could reveal hidden requirements
- Write sandwich code for an accumulator pattern
- Describe more than one approach and choose one with a reason
- Run through the code with actual values, checking at every iteration

## Exercise

### Format

Form a group of 4-5.  It's OK if technical abilities of group members varies - the focus is on the problem-solving technique, not the problems themselves.

Every time you meet, you will repeat the same process.  One person will practice taking an interview, then rotate and another person will take the interview etc...  Your group will have the following roles:

- One person is the **interviewee** - they are the ones who write on the whiteboard / solve the problem
- One person is the **interviewer** - they state the problem and answer questions
- One person is the **observer** and fills out the observation form
  - [this form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i7sMJ5FmuE6pNreOOc_vVFUQx0UhIPfDxaj6b7UwaUQ/edit) or [this one](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B0skKBcLvHyCd2lSS3l2SUt1VmM)
- One person is the **fact checker** and types the code character-for-character to see if it works
- If there are more than four, the others take notes / provide feedback that is ASK (Actionable, Specific and Kind)

Each round should take no longer than 20 minutes.

### After the Interview

- The **fact checker** should runs the final code and report results
- The **observer** should hand the paper feedback form to the interviewee
- The **interviewee** should enter it into their Journal so they can track their progress

### The Interviewee

When you are interviewing, be sure to:

- Confirm two-to-three inputs/outputs before starting
- Ask questions that might reveal hidden requirements / important edge cases
- Discuss more than one approach, choose one and explain your choice
- Write code
  - Use sandwich code
    - close brackets and parens as soon as you open them
    - return variables in accumulator patterns right away, before writing code
  - Think out loud - constantly narrate, don't "go dark"
- Test your code (check your work)
  - Put a variable in
  - Trace it through the code
  - Write down the values at each step if necessary
  - Freely admit your mistakes
- Thank the interviewer

### The Observer

The observer needs to carefully pay attention to and record the following things:

- Interviewee name / date
- Start / end and total time
- Did the code compile? (ask the fact checker)
- Did the code solve the problem? (get group feedback, check with the fact checker)
- How many questions did they ask?
- How many long pauses did they have? (where long pauses are subjective, but 10 seconds of inactivity / talking is long)
- Overall Communication (on a scale of 1-4):
  - Did they ask basic questions (language, compile or pseudo code)?
  - Did they clarify inputs / outputs with examples?
  - Did they explain their thought process as they worked? (i.e. not "going dark")
  - Did they check their work by actually interpreting the code / running inputs through?
  - Did they thank the interviewer and shake hands?

### The fact-checker

Transcribe the code exactly as-is - down to the space and semi-colon.  At the end, run sample input through, and see if you get the expected output.  Show the group if you have any questions.  You'll be asked by the Observer for your findings.

### The interviewer

Your role is to:

- Choose a problem that's appropriate (we'll have a bank of them for you, and also Cracking the Coding interview)
- Explain the problem (ideally leaving out a detail or two that'll come out in questions)
- Answer questions they have
- Try to help them get unstuck without giving away the answer with things like:
  - "what's the value of this variable here...?"
  - "what would you like your array to look like after this first loop?"
  - etc...
- Keep track of time and call time when it's 20 minutes

_If_ the interviewee goes through the answer very quickly, here are some fun ways to keep the interview going:

- Ask them what the runtime of the function is, and also the memory complexity (Big O)
- If they have a loop, ask them to do it without a loop, or with recursion
- If they have lots of variables, ask them to do it with no variables (often requires lots of tiny functions, so may not be appropriate)

### The videographer (optional)

Phones / space / noise permitting, one additional observer can take the interviewee's phone and record the interview, so the interviewee can watch it later an reflect on the feedback.

Interviewees may want to watch themselves so they can see what the interviewer sees (as far as communication, nervousness etc...)

### Other observers

Watch carefully.  Take notes.  Make guesses as to whether the code would run and see if you are correct when the fact-checker finishes.  Try to solve the problem ahead of the interviewee, but in your head or on a piece of paper (silently, that is :)

Please refrain from jumping in, helping, "ooohing" or "aaaahhhing" etc... üòù

### Rotation

Setup a rotation in your group so that everyone places each role on a rotating basis.  The idea is to give each person as much interaction / exposure as possible to this process.
