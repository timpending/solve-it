# Solve It!  Session 1: Learn the Drill

## Objectives

By the end of this session you should be able to:

- Run the *Solve It!** drill effectively with a group

## Description

Session 1 is all about learning the drill.  Each group member should have a chance to play each role, and rotate.  Plan for about 1.5 hours so your group can have enough time to read through this doc, practice, and then reflect on what went well / what didn't.  The code challenges in this exercise are extremely simple, so that your group can focus on efficiently moving through the drill.

## Setup

- Print out [Session 1 Problems](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-m90tKcSdy0B3VizhEBA5T96vDZRNgADr7__jvdBzLM/edit) once
- Print out [the feedback form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i7sMJ5FmuE6pNreOOc_vVFUQx0UhIPfDxaj6b7UwaUQ/edit) once per group member
- Choose the initial roles
- Hand the problems to the **interviewer** so they can read the first problem to the **interviewee**
- Hand the feedback form to the **observer** so they can fill things out as they go
- Make sure the **fact checker** has a computer
- Run the drill once
- Rotate and repeat!

Then run [the drill](./README.md)!
